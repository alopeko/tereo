# VP predicates

The most common negative verb for indicative predicates of this class is *kāore*, usually followed by the subject of the positive sentence then the *VP*:

> *E haere ana ia* > *Kāore ia e haere ana* 'He is not going'  
> *I haere ia* > *Kāore ia i haere* 'He did not go'  
> *Kua haere ia* > *Kāore anō ia kia haere* 'He has not gone (yet)'

Because *ka* is temporally empty, the negation of *ka* varies according to the **pragmatically supplied** tense.
For present and future, the patterns exemplified above are used.
For future, there is a special form of the negative:

| *E* | *kore* | *ia* | *e* | *haere* |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| *T/A* | *NEG* | *3SG* | *T/A* | go |
<center>'He won't go'</center><br/>

Imperative *T/A*s are negated by means of the *NEG* *kaua* followed by a subordinate *VP* marked with *T/A* *e*:

> *Ø haere!* > *Kaua e haere* 'Don't go!'
