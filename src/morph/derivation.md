# Derivation

Māori has a number of affixes which serve to derive new bases, which include:

1. *whaka-*
1. *kai-*
1. *ā-*
1. *-Canga*

## *whaka-*

*Whaka-* is a **causative** prefix, which derives [transitive verbs](./verbs.md#transitive-verbs) from [intransitives](./verbs.md#intransitive-verbs), [neuter verbs](./verbs.md#neuter-verbs), and [adjectives](./verbs.md#adjectives):

| Verb | Derivative |
|--|--|
| *haere* 'go' | *whakahaere* 'organise' |
| *tika* 'be correct' | *whakatika* 'correct (something)' |
| *pau* 'be exhausted' | *whakapau* 'spend, expend' |

With [nouns](./nouns.md), it derives verbs which can mean either transitively 'make into an N', or intransitively 'become an N':

| Noun | Derivative |
|--|--|
| *tangata* 'person' | *whakatangata* 'become a human being' |
| *kūkupa* 'pigeon' | *whakakūkupa* 'turn (something) into a pigeon' |

With [locative nouns](./nouns.md#locative-nouns) and some *NP*s designating places, it derives an adjective of direction:

| Noun | Derivative |
|--|--|
| *runga* 'up' | *whakarunga* 'upwards' |
| *te moana* 'the sea' | *whakatemoana* 'towards the sea' |

These adjectives cannot be used **predicatively**, but only **attributively**:

> *te tai whakarunga* 'the South[^south] coast'  
> *haere whakatemoana* 'to go towards the sea'

[^south] In Māori, South is thought of as upwards.

## *kai-*

*Kai-* derives **agentive** nouns from transitive verbs:

| Verb | Derivative |
|--|--|
| *kōrero* 'speak' | *kaikōrero* 'speaker' |
| *whakahaere* 'organise' | *kaiwhakahaere* 'organiser' |

## *ā-*

*Ā-* derives adjectives from nouns.
These adjectives can be used only **attributively**, and usually mean 'in the manner of X', 'by means of X', or 'as a X'.
These adjectives are spelt with a hyphen between the prefix and the stem and are sometimes attached to the noun or verb they modify:

| Modified | Noun | Derivative |
|--|--|--|
| *waiata* 'song' | *ringa* 'hand' | *waiata ā-ringa* 'action song' |
| *tae* 'arrive' | *tinana* 'body' | *tae ā-tinana* 'arrive in person' |
| *tuku* 'send' | *rorohiko* 'computer' | *tuku ā-rorohiko* 'send by computer' |

## *-Canga*

Similar to the passive suffix, -*Canga* has many allomorphs, and the default is -*tanga*.
This suffix derives nouns from verbs, adjectives, and other nouns.

With verbs, the derived noun designates a single occurrence of the event, or a result of such an event, or the place where such events typically occur:

| Verb | Derivative |
|--|--|
| *patu* 'strike' | *patunga* 'striking' |
| *moe* 'sleep' | *moenga* 'bed' |
| *tae* 'arrive' | *taenga* 'arrival' |
| *oti* 'be completed' | *otinga* 'completion, result' |
| *tuhi* 'write' | *tuhinga* 'writing' |

With adjectives, it derives corresponding abstract nouns:

| Adjective | Derivative |
|--|--|
| *pai* 'good' | *painga* 'goodness, benefit' |
| *tika* 'correct' | *tikanga* 'custom, "right way to do things", meaning' |

With nouns, it derives abstract nouns designating the quality of being the nouns:

| Noun | Derivative |
|--|--|
| *rangatira* 'chief' | *rangatiratanga* 'chiefliness, chiefly rank' |
| *koroua* 'old man' | *korouatanga* 'old age' |
