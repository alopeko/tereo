# Inflectional morphology

There are only two instances of inflection in Māori, as many other categories are expressed by particles:

1. **Irregular plurals**
1. **Passive form of verbs**

## Irregular plurals

There are only eight nouns with an irregular plural form, all but one of which form their plural by **lengthening** the vowel of the antipenultimate mora:

| *SG* | *PL* | Definition |
|--|--|--|
| *wahine* | *wāhine* | 'woman' |
| *tangata* | *tāngata* | 'person, human being' |
| *matua* | *mātua* | 'parent' |
| *tuahine* | *tuāhine* | 'sister of man' |
| *tuakana* | *tuakāna* | 'elder sibling of same sex' |
| *teina* | *tēina* | 'younger sibling of same sex' |
| *tipuna* | *tīpuna* | 'grandparent, ancestor' |
| *tamaiti* | *tamariki* | 'child' |

## Passive

The passive suffix in Māori has 17 allomorphs, which is usually refered to as -*Cia* in Polynesian linguistics, where *C* is a consonant.
Accordingly, most of the allomorphs in Māori are of the same shape: consonant + -*ia*.

With different dialects showing different preferences, the default allomorphs are:

- -*tia*
- -*ngia*
- -*hia*

Some verbs may have multiple passive forms:

> *mahi-a ~ mahi-ngia* 'be done, be made'

Some verbs undergo some change in the stem, usually **lengthening** of the stem vowel:

| Active | Passive | Definition |
|--|--|--|
| *inu* | *inumia* | 'drink' |
| *whakatū* | *whakatūria* | 'set up' |
| *patu* | *patua* | 'strike' |
| *hopu* | *hopukina* | 'grab' |
| *tua* | *tuaina* | 'chop down' |
| *tatari* | *tāria* | 'wait for' |
| *mea* | *meinga* | 'say, do' |
