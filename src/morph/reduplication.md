# Reduplication

Reduplication is the repetition of a certain part in a word.

## Bimoraic roots

**Bimoraic** roots show two patterns of reduplication:

1. **partial**
1. **complete**

### Partial reduplication

Bimoraic partial reduplication is when the first mora of a bimoraic root is reduplicated:

> *patu* > *papatu*

#### Partial reduplication of adjectives

Partial reduplication of a number of [adjectives](./verbs.md#adjectives) serve as an optional plural form:

> *pai* 'good' > *papai* 'good (*PL*)'

The same forms can be also used as **intensives**.

Some colour adjectives can express an **attenuation** of the meaning by partial reduplication:

> *whero* 'red' > *whewhero* 'reddish'

#### Partial reduplication of verbs

These forms are used either for **reciprocal** action, or a **single forceful occurrence** of an action:

> *tohe* 'argue' > *totohe* 'argue together'  
> *kimo* 'blink' > *kikimo* 'keep eyes firmly closed'

### Complete reduplication

Bimoraic complete reduplication is when the whole bimoraic root is reduplicated:

> *hoki* > *hokihoki*

#### Complete reduplication of verbs

Complete reduplication of verbs expresses **plurality** of some kind, either of the action or of the subjects acting individually:

> *hoki* 'return' > *hokihoki* 'return severally'  
> *kuru* 'throw' > *kurukuru* 'to chuck (several things)'

## Trimoraic and longer roots

These show a variety of patterns, of which the most productive are:

1. reduplication of the first two morae
1. reduplication of the last two morae

> *takahi* 'step, stamp' > *takatakahi*  
> *haere* 'go' > *hāereere*[^redup]

[^redup] Note that reduplication of the last two morae lengthens the first vowel, if not already long.
