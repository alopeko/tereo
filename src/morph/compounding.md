# Compounding

In Māori, a base can be used to modify another base.
However, many such sequences of two bases can mean something different when compounded:

> *te whare nui* 'the big house' > *te wharenui* 'the meeting house'  
> *te rā horoi* 'the washing day' > *te Rāhoroi* 'Saturday'

Phonologically, these do not differ.
