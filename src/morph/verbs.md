# Verbs

Verbs form a [**verb phrase**](./vp.md) when combined with a **verbal particle**.

There are five categories of verb in Māori:
1. **Transitive verbs**
1. **Experience verbs**
1. **Neuter verbs**
1. **Intransitive verbs**
1. **Adjectives**

## Transitive verbs

Transitive verbs take an affected **directed object**, usually marked by the preposition *i*:

| *Kei* *te* | *patu* | *ia* | *i* | *t-ā-na* | *kurī.* |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| *T/A* | beat | *3SG* | *OBJ* | *SG*-of-*3SG* | dog |
<center>'He is beating his dog.'</center><br/>

## Experience verbs

Experience verbs include actions such as seeing, hearing, and wanting.
They have a separate **imperative** marking and are incompatible with the **Actor Emphatic** construction.

| *Kua* | *rongo* | *koe* | *i* | *te* | *kōhimuhimu?* |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| *T/A* | hear | *2SG* | *OBJ* | *DET* | rumour |
<center>'Have you heard the rumour?'</center><br/>

## Neuter verbs

Neuter verbs---also called 'statives'---typically take a subject who is a **patient**.
An agent, if explicit, is marked as an oblique by the preposition *i*.

| *I* | *pakaru* | *te* | *wini* | *i* | *a* | *Tamahae.* |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| *T/A* | break:*VN* | *DET* | window | *AG* | *PA* | Tamahae |
<center>'The window was broken by Tamahae.'</center><br/>

## Intransitive verbs

Intransitive verbs does not take a direct object.

| *I* | *oma* | *atu* | *rātou.* |
|--|--|--|--|
| *T/A* | run | *DIR* | *3PL* |
<center>'They ran off.'</center><br/>

*Aha* 'what' can be used with verbal particles---as if it were a verb---to substitute a *VT* or a *VI* in a question:

| *Kei te* | *aha* | *koe?* |
|--|--|--|
| *T/A* | what | *2SG* |
<center>'What are you doing, <em>lit.</em> you are <em>what</em>-ing?'</center><br/>

| *Kua* | *ahatia* | *te* | *kurī?* |
|--|--|--|--|
| *T/A* | what-*AFF* | *DET* | dog |
<center>'What has happened to the dog, <em>lit.</em> the dog has been <em>what</em>-ed?'</center><br/>

## Adjectives

Adjectives were originally not distinguished from neuter verbs, but they exhibit some different properties.

Adjectives have three characteristic distributions:

1. as a following modifier to a noun or verb:

| *he* | *tangata* | *pai* |
|--|--|--|
| *DET* | person | good |
<center>'a good person'</center><br/>

| *Hoki* | *pai* | *atu* |
|--|--|--|
| return | good | *DIR* |
<center>'Get home safely!'</center><br/>

2. predicatively with *he* or with *T/A* particles, the latter being identical to the usage of neuter verbs:

| *He* | *pai* | *te* | *whakaaro.* |
|--|--|--|--|
| *DET* | good | *DET* | thought |
<center>'The idea is good.'</center><br/>

| *E* | *tika* | *ana* | *te* | *kōrero.* |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| *T/A* | correct | *T/A* | *DET* | speak |
<center>'The statement is correct.'</center><br/>

3. following a *DET*, as the corresponding abstract noun:

| *te* | *pai* | *o* | *tēnā* | *whakaaro* |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| *DET* | good | *PREP* | *DET* | thought |
<center>'the appropriateness of that thought of yours'</center><br/>

The comparison of adjectives is expressed by the direction particle *ake* 'upwards' and *atu* 'away, further', and for superlative, the combination of the manner particle *rawa* 'exceedingly' and *atu*:

| *He* | *pai* | *ake* | *tēnei* | *i* | *tēnā.* |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| *DET* | good | *DIR* | *DET* | *PREP* | *DET* |
<center>'This is better than that.'</center><br/>

| *te* | *mea* | *pai* | *rawa* | *atu* |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| *DET* | thing | good | *MAN* | *DIR* |
<center>'the best thing'</center><br/>
