# Nouns

There are three types of nouns in Māori:
1. **Common nouns**
1. **Locative nouns**
1. **Personal nouns**

## Common nouns

Common nouns are followed by **determiners**, such as *te*, *ngā*, *he*, or possessive pronouns:
> *ngā whare* 'the houses'  
> *tōku ingoa* 'my name'  
> *he aha*[^aha] 'what'

[^aha]: *aha* 'what' is a common noun and thus always occur with a determiner.

## Locative nouns

Locative nouns take no determiner when complementing the preposition *ki* 'to' and some others.
They include place name, some time expressions like *nanahi* 'yesterday' and *nāianei* 'now', and a closed set of nouns showing relative position:

> *ki Aotearoa* 'to New Zealand'  
> *i waho* 'outside, *lit.* at outside'

There are two interrogative locative nouns:
1. *hea* 'what place, what time (of present or future)'
1. *nahea* 'what time (of past)'

> *i hea* 'where'  
> *nō nahea* 'when, at what time (past)'

## Personal nouns

Personal nouns require the **personal article** *a* when complementing the preposition *ki* 'to' and some other particles.
They include personal names, names of tribes, personal pronouns, and the names of the months for some speakers:

> *ki a Rei* 'to Ray'  
> *hei a Pipiri* 'in June (future)'  
> *kei a rātou* 'is with them, they have'

There is one interrogative personal noun, which is *wai* 'who'.

Except for the personal pronouns, both locative and personal nouns take the personal artice when used as subject:

| *He* | *tāone* | *nui* | *a* | *Kirikiriroa.* |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| *DET* | town | big | *PA* | Hamilton |
<center>'Hamilton is a big town'</center><br/>

| *Kua* | *mate* | *a* | *Pererika.* |
|--|--|--|--|
| *T/A* | die | *PA* | Pererika |
<center>'Pererika has died.'</center><br/>
