# The structure of the phrase

The base unit of syntax in Māori is the **phrase** rather than the word.

There are three categories of phrase:

1. **Verb phrase (*VP*)**
1. **Noun phrase (*NP*)**
1. **Prepositional phrase (*PP*)**

## Structure

A phrase in Māori consists of three positions:

- **nucleus**
- **peripheries**
  - **preposed (*PrP*)**
  - **postposed (*PoP*)**

### Nucleus

The nucleus of a phrase consists one or more bases.
Most of the time, each base modifies the preceding base:

| *(he)* | *pukapuka* | *reo* | *Māori* |
|--|--|--|--|
| *DET* | book | language | Māori |
<center>'A Māori language book'</center><br/>

These bases precede the base they modify:

- *tino* 'very'
- *āhua* 'somewhat'
- *paku* 'a little'
- *mātua* 'first'
- *tere* 'quickly'

| *(he)* | whare | tino | nui |
|--|--|--|--|
| *DET* | house | very | big |
<center>'a very big house'</center><br/>

#### Object-incorporation

Since the indefinite *DET* *he* is incompatible with prepositions, including the *OBJ* *i*, and indefinite *NP* is incorporated as a modifier to the verb to be used as the object:

| *Kei te* | *hanga* | *whare* | *rātou* | *mō* | *rātou* |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| *T/A* | build | house | *3PL* | *PREP* | *3PL* |
<center>'They are building a house for themselves <em>lit.</em> they are house-building for themselves.'</center><br/>

The only phrases that can have a **zero nucleus** are those in which certain determiners occupy the preposed periphery; for example, *tēnei* 'this' can be used by itself:

> *He aha tēnei?* 'What is this?'

### Peripheries

The peripheries contain **particles**, which can be subcategorised into **preposed particles** and **postposed particles**.

#### Postposed particles

With only two exceptions, all postposed particles can occur in any type of phrase.
There are six paradigms of postposed particles:

| *MAN* | *DIR* | *LOC* ||||
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| *tonu* 'still' | *mai* 'towards speaker' | *nei* 'here' | *anō* 'again' | *hoki* 'also' | *pea* 'perhaps' |
| *rawa* 'very' | *ake* 'upwards' | *nā* 'by you' ||||
| *noa* 'without restriction' | *atu* 'away from speaker' | *rā* 'there' ||||
| *kē* 'other' | *iho* 'downwards' | *ai* *APH* ||||
| *kau* 'alone' || *ana* *T/A* ||||

In general, only one particle from each paradigm will occur in one phrase, and if several types of particles are represented, they will generally occur in the above order:

> *e haere tonu mai nei pea* 'is perhaps still coming here now'
